            Of the many varieties of sweet potatoes, Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato is highly rich in beta-carotene, which
            is an excellent source of Vitamin A. In developing countries where vitamin A deficiency, especially in

            <h3>
                 Can Be Used in Place of Wheat Flour
                       </h3>
            <p>
              Cassava flour is easy to use in recipes in place of traditional grain-based flours or even gluten-free            
              flour blends. One of the best things about using cassava flour is its neutrality in terms of taste. It
              doesn’t have a dry, strong or unfamiliar taste or texture that often comes with using some gluten-free
               flours.
               Many people find that cassava can be used in recipes without it even being detected at all and that
               it’s practically indistinguishable from wheat-basedcounterparts. Its texture blends well to baking
              things like brownies, cookies and denser breads, or you can use it in savory dishes to thicken sauces
              or to form burgers/patties.              
                Many people like baking with cassava flour since it doesn’t have a sour taste or smell that fermented,
                sprouted grain flours sometimes can carry. If you’re going to bake something like bread or cake and
                require a flour that rises well, cassava can be used to replace a portion of the flour in the mixture.
                For recipes that don’t require rising, cassava can totally replace grain flours.</p>
                <h3>
                    Non-Allergenic (Gluten-Free, Grain-Free and Nut-Free)
                     </h3>
                <p>If you’re unable to use coconut or nut-based flours in      recipes (like almondmeal), cassava is another
                    great alternative for gluten-free baking. Some manufacturers even sell high-quality cassava flour
                    that’s gluten-free certified by the the Gluten Intolerance Group.
                    Because it’s totally grain-free, cassava flour is a good choice for more than just those with
                    gluten intolerance symptoms — it’s also paleo-friendly and can also be consumed by people with
                    sensitive digestive systems or disorders, such as irritable bowel disease or irritable bowel
                    disease. (2) In fact, it’s a popular flour alternative for those following an autoimmune protocol
                    diet like the GAPS Diet Plan and Protocol due to its high digestibility.</p><br />
