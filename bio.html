  <h2>The Health Benefits of Every Fruit Juice </h2>
  
  <div class="column1">
   <p> Mint-kale-cucumber-lemon-chia-spinach juice blends are all the rage, and for good reason—they're chock-full of benefits.The health benefits of fruit juices.(Just remember: Always go for cold- and fresh-pressed and avoid anything with added sugars.)</p>

<h3>Watermelon Juice.</h3> 
   <p> Made up of over 90% water, this juice is one of the most hydrating options you can find and contains antioxidants that help decrease chances of heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. Drink it while working out—the citrulline helps to reduce muscle soreness and lower chances of inflammation (bonus: the amino acid is also a natural libido booster for men).</p>

<h3> Pomegranate Juice.</h3>
  <p> An antioxidant bomb, pomegranate juice is filled with vitamins E and C to help reduce wrinkles and protect against sun damage. Pomegranate juice also helps to minimize inflammation and the phytochemicals in the fruit stop the growth of aromatase, one of the major enzymes responsible for breast cancer growth.</p>
  <br>
<h3> Blueberry Juice.</h3>
  <p> The high amounts of flavonoids and disease-fighting antioxidants in blueberry juice may help reduce the chances of Alzheimer's Disease and other mental health disorders. A study done at the University of Cincinnati found a link between blueberry juice and cognitive aging—results concluded that those who consumed blueberry juice scored higher on memory tests as opposed to those who consumed placebo drinks. Consumption may also prevent diabetes and increases the amount of nitric oxide in the body, which helps lower blood pressure.</p>

<h3> Grapefruit Juice.</h3>
  <p> Perfect for beach season, grapefruit juice aids in releasing excess water retention, boosting metabolism and strengthening the immune system. Stick to the ruby reds to manage your weight and control blood sugar.</p>

<h3> Cranberry Juice.</h3> 
  <p>Rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, cranberry juice is considered an anti-inflammatory powerhouse. It's known to help prevent kidney stones, cavities and fend off urinary tract infections.</p>

<h3> Orange Juice.</h3> 
  <p>Juice is best for providing the body with tons of vitamin C. Drink it for a healthy immune system and to fight off damage-causing free radicals. Consuming an eight-ounce glass may also help decrease blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease.</p><br>

<h3> Beet Juice.</h3>
  <p>Beet juice plays a huge role as a liver detoxifier, thanks to betalain, which also gives it its deep red pigment. You don't need very much to reap the benefits—just a small amount each week is enough to stimulate detoxifying enzymes and flush out your system.</p>
  <h3>Plums</h3>
     <p>– The plum collection has varieties from Europe, USA and Canada. Their juicy, succulent flavour made them very popular with the Victorians, who developed many varieties. The collection was replanted in 1995.</p>
  <h3>Pears</h3>
    <p>– The pear collection, like the apple, has varieties from all over the world. Their rich flavours and buttery or gritty texture has meant that pears have been popular for thousands of years.</p>
 
 <h3> Medlars</h3> 
   <p>– Medlars fruit is tart if eaten raw, but makes nicely flavoured jellies and chutneys or can be used in desserts. Left to soften or “bletted” the fruit mellows and the texture softens.
